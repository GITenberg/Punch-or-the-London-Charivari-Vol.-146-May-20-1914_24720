<p>It is comforting to know that we need not yet despair of human nature.
Even the most abandoned politician may have one redeeming quality. For
example, <i>The Express</i> tells us that Mr. <span class="sc">Winston Churchill</span> is a reader
of <i>The Express</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is reported to be the intention of General <span class="sc">Botha</span> to visit this
country in June or July, and the Labour Party here are said to be
already taking steps with a view to having him deported as an
undesirable.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>If Mr. <span class="sc">Henry Chaplin</span> has been correctly reported he is even more of a
reactionary than most of his opponents imagined. In the course of the
debate on the Sunday Closing Bill he is said to have delivered himself
as follows:&mdash;"Drunkenness is diminishing, and I say Thank God; long may
it continue." The pious ejaculation would seem to be an expression of
gratitude for the joys of inebriety.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Does the nightingale really boycott the land of Llewelyn and Mr. Lloyd
George&mdash;and why?" asks an anxious inquirer in a contemporary. If it is
so we suspect the reason is a fear on the part of the bird that the
<span class="sc">Chancellor</span> may get to know of the rich quality of his notes and tax him
out of existence.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">George Storey</span> has been elected a Royal Academician. This will
surprise no one. Burlington House has always favoured the Storey
picture. And as regards Mr. <span class="sc">H. S. Tuke</span>, who was promoted at the same
time, his serial tale, "Three Boys and a Boat," has now been running for
quite a number of years.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"English," says Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span>, "is abominably difficult." But Erse is
worse.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Despatched at Teddington twenty-three years ago a postcard has just been
delivered at Walton-on-Thames. The postal authorities trust that the
publication of this fact will induce people to exercise a little
patience when they do not receive correspondence which they expect,
instead of at once jumping to the conclusion that it has been lost.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>As a consequence of recent outrages at the Royal Academy the Council is
reported to be testing "unbreakable glass." No doubt the Indestructible
Paint Company is also circularising artists.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A man walking across St. Paul's Churchyard gave a remarkable exhibition
of presence of mind one day last week. He was knocked down under a
motor-omnibus, but managed so to arrange himself that the wheels passed
clear of him. Cinema operators will be obliged if he will give them due
notice of any intention to repeat the turn.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The London General Omnibus Company advertises itself, so why shouldn't
we?" said the L.C.C. Tramways&mdash;so they had a nice little collision on
the Embankment last week.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At the second annual celebration of "Mothers' Day" at the London Central
Y.M.C.A., an eloquent address was delivered by the secretary of the
association, Mr. <span class="sc">Virgo</span>. The thought that, in spite of his name, this
gentleman, try as he might, could never become a mother is said to have
raised a lump in the throat of many a member of the audience.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We are glad to hear that "Hospital Egg Week" has been a success. We find
it difficult, however, to believe one account, which states that
sufficient new-laid eggs have been contributed to last the whole year.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"If Adam had lived till now," says Mr. <span class="sc">Snowden</span>, "and had worked hard at
honest labour the whole time, and had been a thrifty man withal, he
would not have had an income like some of those enjoyed to-day." Mr.
<span class="sc">Snowden</span> is apparently presuming that <span class="sc">Adam's</span> wife would have lived as
long as her husband.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At his examination in bankruptcy a Clacton monumental mason attributed
his failure to the healthfulness of the neighborhood. Suggested motto
for Clacton funeral artists: "<i>Si monumentum requiris</i>&mdash;go elsewhere."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Among probable forthcoming improvements at the Zoological Gardens is the
provision of a band on Sunday. But one great difficulty, we imagine,
will be to persuade the laughing hyena and certain other rowdy animals
not to take part in the performances.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The didactic drama is with us again, and this time we are to be taught
to feel affection for the unpopular. <i>Love Cheats</i> is the hortatory
title of a play to be produced by Miss <span class="sc">Horniman's</span> company next month.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Margam Jones</span> has written a volume entitled <i>Angels in Wales</i>.
Nonconformists, we presume.</p>

<h2>BUSINESSFRIENDSHIP.</h2>

<p>Have you heard from &mdash;&mdash; this year? Mine came last night. Of course (to
keep it among ourselves) I am not going to say who &mdash;&mdash; is beyond
mentioning (for the purpose of handy reference) that he appears to have
been christened Josef and that the capital from which he writes (or
alleges that he writes) is associable with a high standard of musical
comedy. His communication is very much underlined, very profuse of the
mark of exclamation in quite unnecessary places (until, indeed, the sign
begins to assume an absolutely satirical value), and very ornate with
little amputated hands, all pointing out the short cut to illimitable
wealth. Now you understand.</p>

<p>The envelope was addressed, as Josef himself assures me that his future
communications will be, "in the most discreet manner," and yet....</p>

<p>"Put it into the waste-paper basket, my dear," I said to Philippa, who
had brought it in with some curiosity. "We need not open it. It is only
Josef offering us another fortune." Need I say that she at once opened
it?</p>

<p>My address, according to Josef, had been given to him "by a mutual
businessfriend." This threw me into a contemplation. Who could it be?
Spraggs had certainly toured the capitals of Central Europe last autumn,
but he never mentioned Josef on his return. Harris? Well, one would
scarcely call Harris a <i>business</i>friend. Filmer? No, Filmer is too
selfish, I fear, to do me so good a turn. Ah, of course! Kelly, dear old
burly rubicund Kelly, with his unfailing memory for an address and his
delightfully abbreviated style. And he goes everywhere too: the very
man. I can almost hear him saying it: "Then there's Johnson, my staunch
old businessfriend Johnson, whom I can trace right back as far as my
impressions of 1912; mustn't leave him out. I think I can&mdash;yes, I have
it: John Fdk. Johnson, 72, Chestnut Av., Mayfield Pk., S.W. You've got
that?" Josef has it.</p>

<p>Josef, it appears, possesses a few tickets, and I gather that for some
reason he does not require all of them himself. Naturally he turns to
the friend of our mutual businessfriend. Will I participate in the
distribution of "many, many million within five months?" The first prize
is one&mdash;but perhaps I had better express it as Josef loves to do. The
first prize is</p>

<table align="center" summary="One Million crs.">
<tr><td><img src="images/rightfinger.gif" width="45" height="20" alt="" title="" />
</td>
<td><b>One Million crs.</b></td><td><img src="images/finger.gif" width="45" height="20" alt="" title="" />
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The chance, he goes on to say, is "without any risk worth mentioning."
Still, he does mention it. He mentions it quite explicitly so that there
shall be no mistake. The risk is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table align="center" summary="cartoon">
<tr><td>&frac14; Ticket sh 8/6.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&frac12; Ticket sh 17/.</td></tr>
<tr><td>1/1 Ticket sh 34/.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>"All tickets forwarded (paid for) belong to the customer," I am assured,
"from the moment of dispatch and play, of course, on his account."</p>

<p>I fancy I see what Josef means, but I don't think that the expression,
"play, of course, on his account," is altogether well chosen. I think it
might have been phrased more felicitously.</p>

<p>You will not be surprised to know that Josef's interest, stimulated by
our mutual businessfriend, goes beyond my mere personality. He reminds
me&mdash;Philippa is quite affected by this&mdash;that there are others. "The
astonishing advantages ... must induce to serious consideration anyone
who is looking after his own welfare, and that of those near and dear to
him as well."&mdash;Yet Josef can be almost stern when there is occasion, and
he tersely warns me that it is a chance which "probably <u><b>never will be offered</b></u>
to you <u><b>again!</b></u>"</p>
<p>Ah, well.</p>

<p>I suppose that I shall give a miss as usual. It isn't that I doubt a
single word of Josef's splendid optimism on my behalf. It isn't that I
really mind the always, to me, inexplicable fact that every second
ticket is guaranteed to draw a prize, while the <i>lowest</i> prize is double
the amount charged for the ticket. It isn't (altogether) that I distrust
Philippa's rosy presentiment. I think it is the concluding paragraph
that settles it. I read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="text-align: center">Will you become <br />
<u><b>A Millionaire?</b></u>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fill out this Order-Form and send it to me by return of post with
the necessary remittance!</p></div>

<p>That last and entirely superfluous note of exclamation seems only to be
adequately vocalised as a chuckle. And as I listen it does not seem to
be myself that is laughing.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> is already using his influence with the new <span class="sc">War
Minister</span>. In the Army Orders for March, 1914, we read:&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE PIERCING OF THE VEIL.</h2>

<p>"I think," says Dr. <span class="sc">Lynch</span> in <i>The Daily Chronicle</i>, "that a man leaves
some trace of himself in every sentence that he writes. What then of
works so extensive as Shakspeare's? Certainly we should see him through
and through if we only knew how to look."</p>

<p><i>We</i> do know how to look, and we have done so with results that can
hardly fail to astonish the reader. It has long been known, for
instance, that <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> was a good man of business, but until our
researches no one had realised quite how good. His theatre had to pay,
and he knew as well as any modern manager how to make it do so. That he
realised, for instance, the attractions of American dance tunes is
evident from his reference to "rags to split the ears of the
groundlings" (<i>Hamlet</i>, Act III., Scene 2).</p>

<p>Apart from his business <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> had private ambitions. We all know
that he applied for a grant of arms, but few are aware that he also
stood for Parliament, and, like many another, regretted the expense
after it was incurred. "Almost all," he says feelingly, "repent in their
election" (<i>Coriolanus</i>, Act II., Scene 3). His exact political views
are still uncertain, but, at any rate, we may be sure that he
disapproved of the Lords, for he boldly announced the fact in the <i>Two
Gentlemen of Verona</i>, Act V., Scene 4, where he says, "One house, one
mutual happiness."</p>

<p>But these are serious matters. What of his hours of ease? That he golfed
there can now be no manner of doubt. In <i>The Tempest</i>, Act IV., Scene 1,
he refers to the "short grassed green," and in <i>Hamlet</i>, Act II., Scene
2, he earns our respect by the simple statement, "I went round," without
any tedious details. Possibly the "thousand marks in links" in the first
part of <i>Henry IV.</i>, Act III., Scene 3, explains this reticence, but, at
any rate, he occasionally found one whom he fancied he could beat;
witness his remark in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, Act II., Scene 3, "Sir Toby, I
must be round with you."</p>

<p>And, golf over, he liked his pipe and his glass. The "smoke and lukewarm
water" mentioned in <i>Timon of Athens</i>, Act III., Scene 6, only needs the
addition of a dash of whisky to make an evening any of us might enjoy;
and his words in <i>Anthony and Cleopatra</i>, Act I., Scene 2, "We bring
forth weeds when our quick minds are still," will find an echo in many a
chest. In this connection it might be noted that he took an occasional
holiday in France. That at least seems a reasonable assumption when so
keen a smoker cries, as he does in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, Act III.,
Scene 1, "I have another bad match."</p>

<h2>THE SUFFERER.</h2>

<p>Having engaged a sleeping-berth I naturally hurried, coin in hand, to
the conductor, as all wise travellers do (usually to their
discomfiture), to see if I could be accommodated with a compartment to
myself and be guaranteed against invasion.</p>

<p>The carriage was full.</p>

<p>I then sought my compartment, to learn the worst as to my position,
whether above or below the necessarily offensive person who was to be my
companion.</p>

<p>He was already there, and we exchanged the hard implacable glare that is
reserved among the English for the other fellow in a wagon-lit
compartment.</p>

<p>When I discovered that to him had fallen the dreaded upper berth I
relaxed a little, and later we were full of courtesies to each
other&mdash;renunciations of hat-pegs, racks and so forth, and charming
mutual concessions as to the light, which I controlled from below&mdash;so
that by morning we were so friendly that he deemed me a fit recipient of
his Great Paris Grievance.</p>

<p>This grievance, which he considered that everyone should know about,
bears upon the prevalence of spurious coins in the so-called Gay City
and the tendency of Parisians to work them off on foreigners. As he
says, a more inhospitable course one cannot conceive. Foreigners in
Paris should be treated as guests, and just now, with all this Entente
talk, the English especially. But no. It is the English who are the
first victims of the possessor of obsolete francs, two-franc and
five-franc pieces guiltless of their country's silver and ten-franc
pieces into whose composition no gold has entered.</p>

<p>He had been in Paris but an hour or so when&mdash;but let me tell the story
as my travelling companion told it to me.</p>

<p>"I don't know what your experience in Paris has been," he said, "but I
have been victimised right and left."</p>

<p>He was now getting up while I lay at comparative ease in my berth and
watched his difficulties in the congested room and thought what horrid
vests he wore.</p>

<p>"I had been in Paris but a few hours," he continued, "when it was
necessary to pay a cabman. I handed him a franc. He examined it, laughed
and returned it. I handed him another. He went through the same
performance. Having found some good money to get rid of him, I sat down
outside a caf&eacute; to try and remember where I had received the change in
which these useless coins had been inserted. During a week in Paris much
of my time was spent in that way."</p>

<p>He sighed and drew on his trousers. His braces were red.</p>

<p>"I showed the bad francs to a waiter," he went on, "and he, like the
cabman, laughed. In fact, next to an undressed woman, there is no stroke
of wit so certain of Parisian mirth as a bad coin. The first thought of
everyone to whom I showed my collection was to be amused." His face
blackened with rage. "This cheerful callousness in a matter involving a
total want of principle and straight-dealing as between man and man," he
said, "denotes to what a point of cynicism the Parisians have attained."</p>

<p>I agreed with him.</p>

<p>"The waiter," he continued, "went through my money and pointed out what
was good and what either bad or out of currency. He called other waiters
to enjoy the joke. It seemed that in about four hours I had acquired
three bad francs, one bad two-franc piece and two bad five-franc pieces.
I put them away in another pocket and got fresh change from him, which,
as I subsequently discovered, contained one obsolete five-franc piece
and two discredited francs. And so it went on. I was a continual target
for them."</p>

<p>Here he began to wash, and the story was interrupted.</p>

<p>When he re-emerged I asked him why he didn't always examine his change.</p>

<p>"It's very difficult to remember to do so," he said, "and, besides, I am
not an expert. Anyway, it got worse and worse, and when a bad gold piece
came along I realised that I must do something so I wrote to the Chief
of the Police."</p>

<p>"In French?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, in English&mdash;the language of honesty. I told him my own experiences.
I said that other English people whom I had met had testified to similar
trouble; and I put it to him that as a matter of civic pride&mdash;<i>esprit de
pays</i>&mdash;he should do his utmost to cleanse Paris of this evil. I added
that in my opinion the waiters were the worst offenders."</p>

<p>"Have you had a reply?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he said, and having completed his toilet he made room for me.</p>

<p>I thought about him a good deal and sympathised not a little, for he
seemed a good sort of fellow and might possibly have had his
calculations as to expenditure considerably upset by his adventures. It
certainly was a shame!</p>

<p>Later, meeting him in the restaurant-car I asked him to show me his
store of bad money. I wanted to see for myself what those coins were
like.</p>

<p>"I haven't got them," he said.</p>

<p>"You sent them to the Chief of the Police with your letter, I suppose?"
I said.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," he replied. "The fact is&mdash;well&mdash;as a matter of fact I
managed to work them all off again."</p>

<h2>VANDALISM.</h2>

<p>The new proposals with regard to the water supply of the City of Glasgow
are causing, we are not surprised to learn, the utmost fury and
consternation throughout Scotland. Criticism has concentrated especially
upon two points: the imminent risk of submerging <span class="sc">Robert the Bruce's</span>
Stone and, of course, the danger of tampering in however slight a degree
with the birthplace of <span class="sc">Rob Roy</span>. The passive resistance movement has
already assumed such proportions that one enterprising publisher feels
justified in announcing a new cheap edition of the "Waverley Novels,"
illustrated from local photographs.</p>

<p>There is, of course, another side to the question. As far as the stone
goes it is contended:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) That no one knows why it should have belonged to <span class="sc">Robert the Bruce</span>,
where he got it or what he did with it when he had it.</p>

<p>(2) That the fact of its being under water would not impair its value in
any way and at the same time would give an historical flavour to every
glass of mitigated whisky thereafter drunk in the City of Glasgow.</p>

<p>(3) That it could very easily be shifted a bit up the hill if it is
desired to keep it dry, and a small permanent umbrella erected over it.</p>

<p>With regard to <span class="sc">Rob Roy's</span> birthplace the contention is that it is
practically impossible to construct a new reservoir in these days
anywhere north of the Tweed which will not interfere in some way with
one or other of the places where <span class="sc">Rob Roy</span> was born.</p>

<p>It is not only Scotchmen, however, who have been touched to the quick by
this irreverent and thoughtless proposal. The whole literary profession
is up in arms. A memorial is being prepared to be presented to the <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span>, under the heading, "Hands off <span class="sc">Rob Roy</span>!" <i>Mr. Punch</i> himself
has not been idle in the matter. He has spent the last week in eliciting
the opinions of some of our leading writers on this vital question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">William de Morgan</span> (in a charming, if rather discursive, letter of
32,000 words) demands legislation. "Who knows," he asks, "to what
lengths this modern craze for water supplies may go? It is even possible
that, within a century, attempts may be made to submerge that delightful
little cottage in the county of Essex where Ghost met Ghost."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Bernard Shaw</span>, interviewed on his doorstep, derided the action of the
Glasgow Corporation. No amount of water, he told our representative,
could have the least effect in making our modern cities less beastly
than they were. For his part, however, he was taking no risks. He had
that morning arranged for the erection of a spiked iron fence twenty
feet high round the (supposed) birthplace of <i>Eliza Doolittle</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Arnold Bennett</span> writes:&mdash;"I have every sympathy with the widespread
indignation of my fellow-authors, but personally I am not very closely
concerned. My position is secure: no one is likely to tamper with the
Five Towns in an attempt to improve their washing facilities."</p>

<p>"Might I suggest to the learned pundits of the House of Lords, if it is
not too late," writes Mrs. <span class="sc">Florence Barclay</span>, "that a writer who, in his
day, enjoyed such a circulation as that of Sir <span class="sc">Walter Scott</span>&mdash;this is, of
course, fundamentally a question of circulation&mdash;is not to be treated in
this cavalier fashion? For oneself, whatever fate may be in store for
the precious local associations of one's past work, it is fortunately
possible to make the future secure. I am laying the scene of my new
romance, of which the fifth chapter is almost completed, on the top of
an inaccessible hill."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">H. G. Wells</span> points out that there is no particular need in his case
to take action. He hopes that by the day when the conditions in time and
space of his latest novel come into

being every household in the country
will be supplied with its own water by a process of filtered absorption
from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that something definite will be done by the special
committee of the Authors Society which has been appointed with the view
of extending the law of copyright so as to secure the author's undoubted
property in his local associations.</p>

<h2>BILLET DOUX.</h2>

<p>Monday's breakfast is never a jovial affair. One always has the feeling
that something dreadful has happened or is going to happen. Thus, three
days ago I had with a light heart handed over my practice to a locum and
my books to an accountant, telling the one to look up my bad patients
and the other to look up my bad debts, while I went away to end the week
with the Wrefords. Twelve hours ago it had seemed that I should never
know such happiness in this world again as I had found with them, and
here we all were on Monday morning with everything changed, Mrs. Wreford
sulking in bed and Wreford displaying a polite but firm hatred of me and
all the world. In this case my feeling was that something dreadful <i>was</i>
happening.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Wreford," said I, as I took my place at table.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Everall," he grunted, barely looking up from his letters, and
that seemed to end the dialogue. When, however, one's host is also one's
most valuable patient, there is call for a special effort. He had all
the correspondence, I had none; in an emergency this suggested itself as
a matter of comment.</p>

<p>"To me," I said chattily, "things seem to be just as badly managed at
the Post Office as they were in <span class="sc">Samuel's</span> time."</p>

<p>"Was there a post office in those days?" he asked, without noticeable
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"<i>The</i> <span class="sc">Samuel Herbert</span>," I explained, and that again seemed to end it.</p>

<p>After a pause, "However," I said kindly, "you enjoy your letters and I
will find what consolation and company I can in a poached egg."</p>

<p>"Enjoy?" asked Wreford. "But you are being sarcastic, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Only panel doctors can afford to be that," I murmured.</p>

<p>Wreford's first letter appeared to pain him, and he looked at me
sternly, as if the evils of this life were all my fault. Then he unbent
a little.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Everall," said he, "have you enjoyed your little visit to us?"</p>

<p>The question took me by surprise but it was, at any rate, one to be
answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"And you are proportionately grateful?" he pursued.</p>

<p>I protested, somewhat lamely, that I most certainly was.</p>

<p>"Gratitude, it seems," said he, "may express itself in the most odd
manner."</p>

<p>"Mine," I replied stiffly, "will express itself in the customary
letter."</p>

<p>"What, another?" he asked, adding, after a pause, "Do you refer to the
note which your solicitors will write me forthwith and charge me
three-and-sixpence for?"</p>

<p>I thought deeply but was baffled. "It is full early in the morning for
the cryptic and abstruse," I said.</p>

<p>Wreford sighed as he slowly folded up his letter and put it in its
envelope. "It is the one moment in the week," he explained, "when the
very worst must be expected."</p>

<p>I begged him to elucidate the position.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said he, "you had invited a man to stay with you for the
week-end, had motored him down from town on the Friday night and given
him dinner and a nice big bed, and on Saturday more meals and more bed,
and on Sunday still more meals and still more bed, and on the Monday
morning a nice yellow-and-white poached egg all to himself."</p>

<p>"I quite appreciate all that," said I.</p>

<p>"And suppose, while he was still sitting at your table and working his
way through the bit of toast where the egg once sat, you received a
letter from him."</p>

<p>"A letter from me?" I cried.</p>

<p>"You said your thanks would be expressed in a letter, but the
promptitude of it has surprised even yourself, hasn't it? I should have
received it yesterday, but that there is no Sunday post, happily."</p>

<p>"You remember I said I was very grateful," said I, still not
understanding.</p>

<p>"And I said that gratitude had a queer way of expressing itself
sometimes," said he, handing over the letter at last. "Read it aloud,"
he added; "I find the style original."</p>

<p>"Harley Street, W. 25th April, 1914," I read. "Thomas Wreford, Esquire,
debtor to John Everall. For professional services, 1912 to 1913,
thirty-eight guineas."</p>

<p>"Go on," he said. "The postscript is where your gratitude becomes the
most exuberant."</p>

<p>"Your attention will oblige," I finished.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think of it?" he asked with a smile.</p>

<p>"I prefer not to," said I, also smiling tentatively.</p>

<p>There was a silence. "However," said Wreford eventually, "let us say no
more about it." At this my smile became firmer and more expansive. "Let
us agree," he said significantly, "to let bygones be bygones."</p>

<p>My smile died out suddenly, as smiles do on a Monday morning.</p>

<h2>THE LANGUAGE OF COLOUR.</h2>

<p>"My dear Clarice," I said, "I may say, in the circumstances, my very
dear Clarice, I like being engaged&mdash;to you, that is; no, I've never been
engaged before&mdash;but I don't see the sense of getting married. Even the
State seems to deride the idea of our union."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Clarice. "I'm almost alarmed. Have they
discovered that you suffered from toothache as a boy?"</p>

<p>"It isn't," I said, "a question of eugenics. I was at Somerset House
to-day getting a copy of my birth certificate, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They surely didn't say anything about our engagement at Somerset House.
I didn't suppose they even knew of it," said Clarice.</p>

<p>"Ill news travels apace," I said. "But that by the way. I was about to
say that red is a noble colour. It is a bold, a striking colour. A day
on which a great event occurs is called 'a red letter day.' Black, on
the other hand, may mean nothing, or it may denote sadness."</p>

<p>"Why this going off at a tangent?" said Clarice. "Why this dissertation
on colours?"</p>

<p>"I say, that's a good word&mdash;I mean that long one just near the end. Did
you really learn it, or did you merely come by it? But, as I was saying,
red is a colour used for indicating notable events. The State considers
a birth is a notable event. Birth certificates are printed in red."</p>

<p>"And death certificates," said Clarice, "in black, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "a delicate hint that the State feels sad."</p>

<p>"And marriage certificates?" asked Clarice.</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, "that's the strange thing. Nothing may be implied really,
but it is significant that they print them in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Purple?" said Clarice eagerly.</p>

<p>"Verdant green," I said.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p>(<span class="sc">Extracted From the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span>)</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 11.</i>&mdash;For a while <span class="sc">Prime Minister's</span>
protest against inordinate questioning, his announcement of
determination not to take part in further shorter catechism more or less
distantly related to the "plot" and the "coup," had wholesome effect. As
he stated, since the plot was discovered he had made seven hundred
replies to friendly inquiries. A Member below Gangway to his right added
the seven hundred and first. Wanted to know whether it is true that the
argumentative questions crowding the notice paper are the product of a
factory in the neighbourhood of Parliament Street, presided over by an
official whose name suggests that he has been "made in Germany."
Expeditiously turned out, as from a sausage machine, is it true that
they are nicely sorted and distributed among Members of the Opposition,
who in turn pelt the <span class="sc">Premier</span> with them?</p>

<span class="sc">Mr. Lloyd George Regards Mr. Balfour's Attitude as
Bellicose.</span>

<p>"If every conciliatory offer put forward by the Government is to be
treated in the spirit displayed by the right hon. gentleman, that is the
way to promote civil war."</p><br />

Mr. <span class="sc"><i>Lloyd George</i></span>.
</div>

<p>After brief lull epidemic breaks out afresh. Twenty-three Questions
addressed to <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> to-day appear on printed paper. As each,
with the aid of semi-colons, represents two, three, occasionally five
distinct queries they reach aggregate of half a hundred. This not
counting Supplementaries.</p>

<p>Happily the <span class="sc">Premier</span> is incomparable master of the rare art of brief
reply, wherein he presents pleasing contrast to the manner of his old
master, <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>. Had he chanced to be Premier when the Fourth Party
were struggling into notoriety their task would have been more
difficult, their triumph delayed if not unattainable.</p>

<p>When <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, <span class="sc">Wolff</span> and <span class="sc">Gorst</span>, with <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> looking on, set
themselves to "draw <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>," as was their custom of an afternoon,
that astute personage became as a child in their hands. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> led
off with a question, to which long reply was made. <span class="sc">Wolff</span>, profusely
grateful for the right hon. gentleman's courtesy, shunted the <span class="sc">Premier</span> on
to another track, along which he cheerfully sprinted. Then came <span class="sc">John o'
Gorst</span>. With the subtlety of a trained but not practising barrister he
put a third question, drawing a third speech. Thus merrily sped a
quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, deferring by so much the progress
of public business.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Asquith's</span> share in the conversation at the Question hour is based on a
familiar Biblical injunction. It is largely composed of "Yea, yea," and
"Nay, nay." In the case alluded to, wherein the Fourth Party gave play
to their insatiable desire for information, he would have replied to
<span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, "Yes, Sir;" to <span class="sc">Wolff</span>, "No, Sir." Had he been exceptionally
lured into verbosity he might have gone as far as to say, "The answer is
in the negative," or "in the affirmative," as the case might be. As for
<span class="sc">John o' Gorst</span>, he would have referred him to a speech made on a
particular preceding date, "to which I have nothing to add."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> further explains his Budget. Resolutions
founded thereupon agreed to.</p>

<p><i>Nurse <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</i> "I must have notice of that question."</p>
</div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;What at outset promised to be businesslike debate verging on
dulness suddenly leapt into flame and fury, signifying angry passion
stirred by Home Rule Bill. In studiously moderate speech <span class="sc">Premier</span> moved
resolution identical with that adopted last year, whereby Committee
stage of Home Rule Bill, Welsh Church Disestablishment and Plural Voting
will be forgone. Pointed out that Committee stage is designed for
purpose of providing opportunity of amending Bills. Since under
Parliament Act none of these measures can be amended in the Commons,
what use to go into Committee on them?</p>

<p>Being in increasingly businesslike mood <span class="sc">Premier</span> went a step further.
Abandoned proposal to submit and discuss "suggestions" to Home Rule
Bill. Authoritatively announced by <span class="sc">Walter Long</span> and others that the Lords
are predetermined to throw it out on second reading. What use then to
formulate and discuss suggestions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span> that could be dealt with by the Lords
only in subsequent Committee? Finally announced intention of getting
Bill through all Parliamentary stages before Whitsuntide, placing it on
Statute Book by automatic process of Parliament Act. Will then bring in
Amending Bill dealing with Ulster.</p>

<p>It was <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> who roused crowded House from chilled condition
following upon douche of this application of ordinary business
principles to legislative procedure. In best fighting form. Stirred to
profoundest depths of scorn for actual working of that detested statute,
the Parliament Act.</p>

<p>"We are," he said, amid strident cheers from Opposition, welcoming their
old captain back to the fighting line, "asked to force through under the
Parliament Act a Bill which by hypothesis requires amendment. What is
worse than that is that we are to be compelled to read it a third time
and to part with it while we know that it is to be amended, but while we
have not the smallest conception in what respects or in what way."
Insisted that before Home Rule Bill is added to Statute Book Parliament
should know in what points it would be amended. "Let us have the
Amending Bill first."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> having stirred the embers of slumbering fire, <span class="sc">Chancellor
of Exchequer</span> vigorously fanned them.</p>

<p>"If," he said, "every conciliatory offer put forward by the Government
is to be treated in the spirit displayed by the right hon. gentleman,
that is the way to promote civil war."</p>

<p>Hereupon storm burst over Opposition quarters. Shouts of "Shame!" and
"Liar" hurtled through the suddenly heated atmosphere. The <span class="sc">Chancellor's</span>
attempt to proceed with his speech baffled by continuous
cry,&mdash;"Withdraw! Withdraw!" At length <span class="sc">Speaker</span> interposed with suggestion
that the <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> had been misunderstood. Claimed for him the right of
explanation. This conceded, <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> pointed out that what he had
meant to say was that argument such as that forthcoming from Front
Opposition Bench, making it difficult for the Government to submit
proposals of peace, would have effect of promoting civil war.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> naturally falling into "old style" of House of Commons
debate, not only frankly accepted explanation but chivalrously took upon
himself blame of the outbreak, which he said "apparently arose from an
unfortunate expression of mine." Ended with pretty turn of grave satire
that greatly pleased the House.</p>

<p>After this, debate quietly proceeded to appointed end, everyone mutely
invoking</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Blessings on the falling out<br /></p>
<p class="i2">That all the more endears,<br /></p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Remarkable how <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> (or was it <span class="sc">Bacon</span>?) wrote not only
for all time but for all circumstance. The marvel came to light again in
scene in House yesterday.

Writing of the time of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span> reports dialogue
between two fighting men of the houses of <i>Capulet</i> and <i>Montague</i>.
Meeting <i>Sampson</i> in a public place in Verona, <i>Abram</i> truculently asks.

<p><span class="sc">Kinloch-Cooke</span>, having put question to <span class="sc">Wedgwood Benn</span>, following it up by
two supplementary inquiries, put a third when the <span class="sc">Speaker</span> interposed.
Shrugging his shoulders in silent protest against this tyranny
<span class="sc">Kinloch-Cooke</span> resumed his seat.</p>

<p>Said the <span class="sc">Speaker</span> sternly, "It is no good shrugging your shoulders at
me."</p>

<p>This is prosaic account of incident given in this morning's papers.
Refer to <i>Hansard</i> and see how it runs.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Speaker</span>.</i> Do you shrug your shoulders at me, Sir?</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Kinloch-Cooke</span>.</i> I do shrug my shoulders, Sir.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Speaker</span>.</i> Do you shrug your shoulders at me, Sir?</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Kinloch-Cooke</span> (aside to <span class="sc">Winterton</span>).</i> Is there anything in the Standing
Orders that forbids my shrugging my shoulders at the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>?</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Winterton</span> (who is training for Speakership and has them all by heart).</i>
Yes.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Kinloch-Cooke</span>.</i> No, Sir, I do not shrug my shoulders at you, Sir; but I
shrug my shoulders.</p>

<p><i><span class="sc">Speaker</span>.</i> Order! Order!</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Another plot that failed. For some weeks Opposition
have not attempted to snap a division. Ministerialists, lulled into
sense of security, off guard. Secret preparations sedulously made for
trapping them this afternoon. Questions over, division challenged on
formal motion. Ministerial Whips awake in good time to emergency. Urgent
messages had been sent out to their men by telephone and special
messengers. Arrivals watched with feverish interest. Ministerialists
hurriedly drop in by twos and threes, presently by tens. <span class="sc">Illingworth's</span>
massive brow, temporarily seared with wrinkles, smooths out. When, after
division, Clerk hands paper to him indicating that ambush has been
baffled, hilarious cheer rises from Ministerial benches. Renewed when
figures read by the <span class="sc">Speaker</span> show that the motion is carried by 255 votes
against 234.</p>

<p>"Not a high-class game in imperial politics," says <span class="sc">Sark</span>. "Rather akin to
the humour of making a butter slide on the pavement for the discomfiture
of unsuspecting passers-by. But boys will be boys."</p>

<h2>A NATIONAL CALAMITY.</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">Great Performer contemplates Retirement.</span></h4>

<p>Once more the Atlantic liner has delivered Mr. Bamborough (<i>n&eacute;</i>
Bamberger) back to us, and once more British concert-goers should in
consequence rejoice. But their natural jubilations are unfortunately
tempered by a momentous announcement which the great violinist made to
our representative at Plymouth last week, on the arrival of the <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i>, to the effect that he has decided to retire from the active
pursuit of his profession. On receiving the news of this national
calamity our representative fell into a heavy swoon, and was revived
with some difficulty. The thought of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> permanent withdrawal from
public life in his golden prime of the great virtuoso, with his opulent
physique, his superbly Mosaic features and his luxuriant chevelure, was
altogether too poignantly overwhelming. Let us hasten then to reassure
our readers that the blow, though it must inevitably descend one day, is
mercifully deferred for a considerable period. To begin with, Mr.
Bamborough is under contract to give five farewell tours in the United
States at intervals of four years before entering upon the penultimate
stage of his severance from the British concert platform. This, which
will begin in the autumn of 1934, is likely to continue until the year
1948, when he is booked for an extended tour in Polynesia, Japan, New
Guinea and Java. On his return to England in 1950 he proposes to give
sixty farewell recitals at intervals of three months, culminating in a
grand concert at the Albert Hall.</p>

<p>"And then," mused the illustrious artist, "farewell to the platform for
ever! I find it hard indeed to realise that the concert-going public and
I by that time will have been intimate friends for more than seventy
years, but so it will be, for I was only nine when I made my first
appearance in London, in a velvet knickerbocker suit with pearl buttons
and a Fauntleroy collar. Still, it will all make a lovely retrospect for
me, and when I finally retire it will be with a heart very full of
gratitude to my generous friends in all four hemispheres of the globe."</p>

<p>"And after that?" suggested our representative, now partially restored
by these reassuring tidings.</p>

<p>"After that&mdash;literature," was the emphatic reply. "I have already signed
a contract with Messrs. Goodleigh and Champ to write my Reminiscences in
the form of a Musical Encyclop&aelig;dia. My father-in-law, Sir Pompey
Boldero, is giving me valuable assistance in preparing the material, but
as he is already sixty-five I cannot, unhappily, count with absolute
confidence on his being spared to witness the completion of the work.
Still, he is so full of vigour that M. <span class="sc">Metchnikoff</span> considers his chances
of becoming a centenarian decidedly promising. In any case the
collaboration of my children, whose filial devotion is only equalled by
their talent, is secured, and Mrs. Bamborough, as you know, wields a
vivid and trenchant pen. But literature will not occupy all my time. My
estancia in the Argentine will need supervision, and I hope to spend an
occasional summer in the Solomon Islands, where the natives are
strangely attached to us."</p>

<p>Mr. Bamborough pointed out that Sir <span class="sc">Johnston Forbes-Robertson</span>, who also
returned by the <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, had only drawn receipts amounting to
&pound;107,000 in a tour of thirty weeks' duration, while he (Mr. Bamborough)
had netted no less than &pound;150,000 in a tour lasting twenty-seven weeks
and three days. In addition to the receipts in specie, Mr. Bamborough
had received several nuggets from the gold miners in Colorado, and a
bull moose from Mr. <span class="sc">Kermit Roosevelt</span>, while Mrs. Bamborough had been the
recipient of a highly-trained bobolink, and a charming young
alligator from the cedar swamps of Louisiana.</p>

<p>Other notable passengers on the <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> were Miss Topsy Cooney,
the famous coloured pianist, who plays only on the black keys and
entirely by ear; Little Dinky, the marvellous calculating boy, who does
not know the names of the numbers; and Elaine Runnymede, the child
contralto, who can only sing the whole tone scale.</p>

first we must find if he was wearing one at all. Call Susan.</p>

<p><i>Enter </i>Susan<i>, the lady's-maid.</i></p>

<p><i>Grumpy.</i> Susan, you were the first to see Mr. Ernest when he came in
last night. Did you happen to notice if he was wearing a detachable
shirt-front, a&mdash;h'm&mdash;dicky?</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Grumpy.</i> Ah! (<i>He hands her the all-important clue.</i>) Was this it?</p>

<p><i>Susan (examining it).</i> No, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Grumpy.</i> Tut-tut, are you sure?</p>

<p><i>Susan.</i> Yes, Sir; Mr. Ernest's was an india-rubber one. I know, because
he said he'd been travelling all day, and he asked me to sponge it for
him.</p>

<p><i>Grumpy.</i> Thank you, Susan. Ruddock, we must find that india-rubber
richard. If Ernest has his assailant's shirt-front, what more likely
than that his assailant has Ernest's? Probably they exchanged them
before the battle, as, you may remember, Glaucus and Diomed did at the
siege of Troy.</p>

<p><i>Ruddock.</i> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Grumpy.</i> Every shirt-front we see we must suspect. Let us go and look
for some.</p>

<p><i>Virginia.</i> Still in evening dress, Mr. Jarvis?</p>

<p><i>Jarvis.</i> Yes, I was so busy fetching the doctor last night that I had
no time to change. I am going back to London now. (<i>Tenderly</i>) I should
like to think you had some little memento of me. (<i>He removes his shirt
front.</i>) Keep this and think of me sometimes when you look at it.</p>

<p><i>Virginia.</i> Oh, Mr. Jarvis! But I must give <i>you</i> something too. (<i>She
goes out and returns with one of her grandfather's shirt-fronts.</i>) Wear
this in place of the one you have given me&mdash;always.</p>

<div class="direction">
[<i>Exit.</i>
<p><i>Re-enter </i>Grumpy<i>.</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>Grumpy.</i> Now, Mr. Jarvis, I wonder if you would help me. You were the
first to find the body last night. Would you mind lying down in the
position in which it lay? It may give me an important clue.</p>

<p><i>Jarvis.</i> Certainly. (<i>He prepares to lie down.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Grumpy.</i> Take care, you mustn't crumple your shirt-front. Perhaps it
removes? Ah, allow me. (<i>He detaches it and hastily substitutes the
other one for it.</i>) Ah, thank you so much. Here is your shirt-front
again.</p>

<p><i>Argentine Mediator.</i> Cold, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>Brazilian Mediator.</i> Yes, there's a great deal of cold in the

<p><i>A. M.</i> There's a lot of water coming down.</p>

<p><i>B. M.</i> Yes, and it keeps coming, too, doesn't it?</p>

<p><i>C. M.</i> It isn't as noisy as I thought it would be, though.</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> Oh, I don't know. It's quite noisy enough.</p>

<p><i>B. M.</i> Yes, it's very difficult to concentrate one's mind. We've got a
waterfall in Brazil which has the same effect. You can't do any work
near it. People go there for a rest-cure.</p>

<p><i>C. M.</i> There are a good many waterfalls in Chili, too, and they make
more noise than this one.</p>

<p>(<i>A pause.</i>)</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> How long do you think we shall be here?</p>

<p><i>B. M.</i> A week, or a month, or a year&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><i>C. M.</i> It's a dull place, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>B. M.</i> Out with it, then.</p>

<p><i>C. M.</i> Yes, let's have it.</p>

<p><i>A. M.</i> Well, then, suppose we start by saying that <span class="sc">Huerta</span> and <span class="sc">Wilson</span>
must <i>both</i> be eliminated. That'll please both sides. <span class="sc">Huerta</span> will be
tickled to death if <span class="sc">Wilson</span> has to go, and <span class="sc">Wilson</span> will be delighted at
our backing up his policy. What do you think?</p>

<p><i>B. M.</i> I can't think at all in this noise.</p>

<p><i>C. M.</i> Nor can I, but I daresay it's all right.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<div class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</div>

<p>Not the least attractive feature in Madame <span class="sc">Waddington's</span> new book, <i>My
First Years as a Frenchwoman</i> (<span class="sc">Smith, Elder</span>), is the revelation,
undesignedly made, of a keen-sighted, vivacious, exceedingly womanly
woman. During her residence in France as the wife of a highly placed
Minister she had rare opportunity of watching the progress of historic
events from a favoured standpoint behind the scenes. When she married M.
<span class="sc">Waddington</span>, in later years known to this country as French Ambassador,
the National Assembly was sitting at Versailles. <span class="sc">Thiers</span>, first President
of the Republic, had been overthrown and <span class="sc">MacMahon</span> reigned in his stead.
Madame <span class="sc">Waddington</span> was brought into personal touch with these statesmen,
with their successors, <span class="sc">Jules Gr&eacute;vy</span>, <span class="sc">de Freycinet</span>, <span class="sc">Carnot</span> and with their
varied <i>entourage</i>. Of each she has something shrewd, sprightly and
informing to say. While immersed in international politics, perhaps not
wholly free from anxious conviction that she was in some measure
responsible for their direction, she had a seeing eye for frocks.
Frequently, when describing social gatherings at the height of political
crises, she stops to tell you how some lady was dressed and how the
apparel suited her. Amongst other men of the epoch she has something to
say about <span class="sc">Blowitz</span>, the famous Paris correspondent of <i>The Times</i>. It is
evident that, without premeditation, he managed to offend the lady. She
reports how Prince <span class="sc">Hohenlohe</span> expressed a high opinion of the journalist,
remarking, "He is marvellously well-informed of all that is going on."
"It was curious," writes Madame, "how a keen clever man like the Prince
attached so much importance to anything Blowitz said." For the
side-lights which it flashes on high life in Paris at a critical period
of the Republic the volume possesses exceptional value.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The subtleties of human motives, the fine problems of temperament, the
delicate interplay of masculine logic and feminine intuition, what are
these compared to blood, thunder, plots, counter-plots, earthquakes and,
from the final chaos, the salvage of the "sweetest woman on earth"
effected in the nick of time by a herculean and always imperturbable
hero? Mr. <span class="sc">Frank Savile</span> is not out to analyse souls. The opening chapter
of <i>The Red Wall</i> (<span class="sc">Nelson</span>) plunges us into a fray, irrelevant to the
narrative save in so far as it introduces <i>Dick Blake</i> and <i>Eileen
O'Creagh</i> and removes any possible doubt that might ever have been felt
as to their respective merits and their mutual suitability. That
preliminary complete, we proceed to the real business of the agenda, and
momentous, passionate, nefarious, diabolical, mysterious and incessantly
exciting business it is, covering the gamut of private emotions and
international complications. In such narratives I demand three things:
the first, that my author should combine a graphic (and grammatical)
style with the professional knack of imparting an air of probability to
his tale; the second, that things should go all wrong in the beginning
and come all right in the end; the third, that if any German schemers
are involved these should be eventually outwitted. Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span> <span class="sc">Savile</span> has
abundantly satisfied me in all particulars; although I incline to carp
at the opportuneness with which nature is made to erupt from time to
time, and I venture to suggest that men and women never were and are
probably never going to be like <i>Dick</i> and <i>Eileen</i>. The book is,
however, of the sort which is to be read and enjoyed but not considered
further.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>Joe Quinney</i>, the curiosity shop man in Mr. <span class="sc">Horace Annesley Vachell's</span>
<i>Quinneys'</i> (<span class="sc">Murray</span>), is undoubtedly a "card," not unrelated, I should
say, to Mr. <span class="sc">Bennett's</span> <i>Machen</i>. He is an entertaining fellow with his
enthusiasms, his truculences, his fluctuating standards of honesty. Mr.
<span class="sc">Vachell</span> didn't quite get me to believe in <i>Joe's</i> expert knowledge,
which indeed seemed to be turned on and off in rather an arbitrary way
as the exigencies of the story rather than the development and
experience of the character dictated; but he did make me see and like
the fellow. <i>Mrs. Quinney</i>, that faithful timid soul, is admirably
drawn, both in her courtship and her matronly days. But I found
<i>Quinney</i> a little hypocritical in his denunciation of <i>Miggott</i>, the
chair-faker, who was not really sailing half so close to the wind or so
profitably as <i>Quinney</i> and his bibulous friend of a dealer, <i>Tamlin</i>.
There are some interesting side-lights upon the astonishing tricks of
the furniture trade, which are reflected by the authentic experience of
the bitten wise. An entertaining and clever book; but why, why should H.
A. V. drop from his Hill into the discreditable fellowship of those who
have misquoted "honoured in the breach"?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Anybody can understand how extremely annoying and inconvenient the
complete disappearance of a husband would be to a wife after a mere
fortnight or so of married existence, before he had even begun to
complain of the&mdash;well, anyhow that is what happens in Mrs. <span class="sc">Belloc
Lowndes's</span> latest novel, <i>The End of Her Honeymoon</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>). The
<i>Dampiers</i> arrive in Paris, a Paris <i>en f&eacute;te</i> and crowded beyond all
custom because of the state visit of the <span class="sc">Tsar</span>, and are obliged to occupy
rooms on different floors of the <i>Poulains'</i> hotel. Next morning <i>Mrs.
Dampier</i> awakes to find herself in the awkward predicament of Ariadne on
the beach of Naxos, with the aggravation (spared to Theseus' bride) that
the hotel people absolutely deny that she came with a husband at all. A
punctilious if sceptical American senator (refreshingly guiltless of
accent) and his enthusiastic son and daughter take pity on her, and the
rest of the book resolves itself into a detective story, saved from
conventionality by the pleasantly distinguished style in which the
author writes and the intimate knowledge which she appears to possess of
the Paris <i>pr&eacute;fecture de police</i>. <i>Gerald Burton</i>, the young American,
not entirely platonic in his solicitude, is baffled; <i>Salgas</i>, a famous
enquiry agent, is baffled; and I am ready to take very long odds against
the reader's unravelling the mystery, unless he happens to be familiar
with a certain legend of the plague (though no plague comes in here).
Indeed, it is only a chance conversation in the last chapter that throws
light, my dear Watson, on this particularly <i>bizarre</i> affair. And what
then, you ask, had happened to <i>Jack Dampier</i> after all? Ah!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I wonder why it is that so many books about walking tours should be
written in much the same style. At least I don't really wonder at all,
since it is quite apparent that R. L. S. and <i>Modestine</i> are the models
responsible for this state of things. And, since the style in itself is
pleasant enough, I don't know that any one need complain. What put me
upon this reflection was <i>Vagabonds in Perigord</i> (<span class="sc">Constable</span>), which, for
the modulation of its prose, might almost have been an unacknowledged
work of the Master, but is actually written by Mr. <span class="sc">H. H. Bashford</span>. It
concerns the wanderings on foot of certain pleasure pilgrims along the
course of the river Dordogne; and is, for those that like such things,
one of the most attractive volumes I have met this great while. I liked
especially the author's happy gift of filling his pages with a holiday
atmosphere; there is, indeed, so much fresh air and sunshine in them
that the sympathetic reader will emerge feeling mentally bronzed. Nor
does Mr. <span class="sc">Bashford</span> lack an agreeable humour of phrase. "Those wonderful
three-franc dinners that seem to fall like manna upon France at seven
o'clock every evening" is an example that lingers in my memory.
Moreover, running through the whole is a hidden joke, and very cunningly
hidden too, only to be revealed in the last paragraphs. Not for worlds
would I reveal it here; I content myself with admitting that I for one
was entirely fooled. I am less sure whether as a record of travel the
book tempts to emulation. The drawbacks are perhaps too vividly rendered
for this&mdash;heat and thirst through the flaming June days, and by night
not wholly unbroken repose. But I am delighted to read about it all.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Bram Stoker</span>, whose too early cutting off saddened a wide circle of
friends, was the Fat Boy of modern writers of fiction. He knew how to
provide opportunity in fullest measure for making your flesh creep. A
series of stories named after the first, <i>Dracula's Guest</i> (<span class="sc">Routledge</span>),
is a marvellous collection of weird fancies wrought with ingenuity,
related with graphic power, that come as near <span class="sc">Edgar Allan Poe</span> as
anything I am acquainted with. There are nine, widely varying in subject
and plot. I have read them all, and am not ashamed to confess that,
finishing one before commencing another of the fascinating series, I
found it convenient and agreeable to turn aside for a while and glance
over less exciting pages. Not the least marvellous thing about the
banquet is that it is provided at the modest charge of a shilling.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
